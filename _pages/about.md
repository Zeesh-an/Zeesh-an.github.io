Hi there! I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at Emory University, advised by [Dr. Liang Zhao](https://cs.emory.edu/~lzhao41/). My research focuses on graph machine learning and foundation models for complex networks. I obtained my B.E. in Software Engineering from the National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST), Pakistan, in 2024, where I worked under [Dr. Faisal Shafait](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=o9RCNZYAAAAJ&hl=en).

I have previously collaborated with CERN, RheinMain University of Applied Sciences, and the Deep Learning Lab (SEECS, NUST) on projects spanning satellite image super-resolution, OCR for low-resource languages and prompt optimization for LLMs.
